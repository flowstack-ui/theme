# FLOWSTACK Theme system

## Purpose

Author, compile, and integrate a project theme without changing Brick component meaning or moving application runtime ownership into Theme.

## Decision order

1. Identify brand and product colors as project palettes and roles before mapping any value to Brick.
2. If using Colors, review its candidate explicitly and scaffold selected families through the serialized file interchange.
3. Install a released Brick version whose theme contract revision is supported by Theme.
4. Map only UI meanings Brick owns into brick.light and brick.dark; keep charts, syntax, editorial, and campaign colors in project roles or namespaced extensions.
5. Use appearanceRoles for optional project or package meanings that vary between light and dark, and declare their maintained foreground/background relationships explicitly.
6. Override a complete atomic Brick family or inherit that entire family from Brick defaults.
7. Use only Brick-declared component theme inputs and treat their closed values as project-wide policy with component props remaining available for local exceptions.
8. Compile at build time, review the contrast report and static artifacts, then ship the CSS rather than the compiler.
9. Let the application own activation, saved preference, fonts, assets, portals, and first-paint behavior.

## Selection map

- **Author a deterministic theme source:** use defineTheme with the flowstack.theme.v1 schema and JSON-compatible values.
- **Check a theme definition before compatibility work:** use validateThemeDefinition for diagnostics or assertThemeDefinition for a throwing boundary.
- **Qualify Theme against Brick:** use load and assert the theme-contract.json belonging to the exact installed Brick version.
- **Start from generated Colors candidates:** use the serialized, explicitly reviewed Colors candidate and scaffold mapping handoff.
- **Resolve semantic values and prove completeness and contrast:** use compileTheme against the selected installed Brick contract.
- **Produce files for an application build:** use compileThemeFiles and writeThemeArtifacts for the complete deterministic CSS, token, manifest, and report set.
- **Validate, scaffold, or compile from automation:** use the flowstack-theme CLI with explicit JSON, contract, mapping, and output paths.
- **Activate a compiled theme or choose product-specific brand direction:** use application-owned runtime and authorized project inputs after Theme emits static artifacts.

## Rules

- **MUST:** Keep theme definitions JSON-compatible and deterministic; do not use functions, DOM state, environment-dependent values, or runtime callbacks.
- **MUST:** Compile against the theme-contract.json exported by the installed Brick package and do not maintain a copied semantic-token list.
- **MUST:** Treat Colors as optional serialized file input; never add a Colors runtime dependency or map an unreviewed candidate.
- **MUST:** When one member of an atomic Brick color family changes, provide the complete family for that appearance or inherit the complete Brick default.
- **MUST:** Map values by semantic UI meaning; never misuse warning, danger, success, or information merely to obtain a desired hue.
- **MUST:** Keep unlimited non-Brick brand, visualization, syntax, editorial, and product colors in palettes, roles, or namespaced extensions.
- **MUST:** Treat insufficient or unprovable Brick-declared and project-declared contrast pairs as build failures; do not round a failing ratio into a pass.
- **MUST:** Define every appearance-aware project role for every supported appearance, keep its logical meaning stable, and do not duplicate the same path in invariant roles.
- **MUST:** Ship compiled static CSS and keep @flowstack-ui/theme in build tooling unless a separately qualified runtime adapter is introduced.
- **MUST:** Keep theme selection, persistence, pre-paint setup, font and asset loading, and portal-container coordination in the application.
- **MUST:** Do not add theme breakpoints expecting them to recompile Brick media queries; Brick component breakpoints and application layout policy have separate owners.
- **SHOULD:** Use components only for inputs explicitly audited in the Brick contract; honor closed allowed values and their conditional validation, and keep local component token overrides local.

## Ownership

### Brick

- accessible default values
- semantic UI roles and component recipes
- atomic families, contrast pairs, and approved component inputs

### Theme

- serializable project values and mappings
- compatibility, completeness, alias, and contrast validation
- appearance-aware project roles and explicit project relationships
- deterministic CSS, token, manifest, and report artifacts

### Application

- activation and saved preference
- font and asset loading
- first paint, portals, routes, and product art direction

## Native and application fallback

1. Check whether the task is deterministic Theme authoring, validation, compatibility, compilation, artifact writing, or CLI automation before using this package.
2. Use application-owned integration for runtime activation, persistence, first paint, fonts, assets, portal placement, routes, and product-specific art direction.
3. Report a Theme or Brick contract gap instead of copying semantic tokens, weakening validation, inventing brand decisions, or shipping the compiler in the browser.

## Validation checklist

- Validate the definition envelope before compiling.
- When using Colors interchange, confirm the candidate review and scaffold report identify the intended families and semantic jobs.
- Compile against the exact installed Brick contract revision and review every diagnostic.
- When a categorical component input activates conditional validation, confirm every resulting contrast pair passes in every supported appearance.
- Confirm every appearance role is complete and every declared project relationship passes in every supported appearance.
- Confirm theme.report.json contains one passing result for every declared pair and supported appearance.
- Verify generated artifacts are byte-stable and committed only when the application owns committed build output.
- Build the production application and verify explicit light, dark, nested appearance, portal, first-paint, and forced-colors behavior where applicable.
- Confirm the browser bundle does not contain the Theme compiler.
