# Agent Knowledge

Theme publishes the same ownership and validation guidance for humans and
coding agents.

```js
import manifest from "@flowstack-ui/theme/agents/manifest.json" with { type: "json" };
```

The manifest points to:

- `@flowstack-ui/theme/agents/theme-system.json` for structured decisions,
  rules, ownership, and validation checks; and
- `@flowstack-ui/theme/agents/theme-system.md` for the equivalent readable
  guide.

It also links `@flowstack-ui/theme/agents/coverage.json`. The deterministic
`flowstack.agent-coverage.v1` report reconciles every public root and schema
symbol plus the `flowstack-theme` CLI with seven selectable operation owners:
definition, validation, installed Brick contract compatibility, Colors file
interchange, compilation, artifact writing, and CLI automation. Release checks
require all seven operations and every public surface to be classified, routed,
and failure-free.

`agents/theme-system.json` is the structured authority and its Markdown is
generated from that file. `npm run agents:build` regenerates the source
Markdown and complete `dist/agents` directory. `npm run agents:check` rejects
source/Markdown drift and missing, stale, or extra generated artifacts.

Agents should read this package guide together with Brick's package and
component Agent Knowledge. Brick teaches component selection and semantic
consumption; Theme teaches project value mapping and compilation. Neither
artifact grants an agent permission to invent brand direction. Creative input
and application product intent remain explicit inputs.

Theme reads the contract belonging to the exact installed Brick build input;
it does not copy Brick's token inventory or depend on Brick at runtime. Colors
is an optional reviewed serialized handoff and is likewise not a Theme runtime
dependency. Applications continue to own activation, persistence, first paint,
fonts, assets, portals, routes, and delivery of the compiled CSS.
