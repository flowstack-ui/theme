# Authoring

A theme definition is serializable project data. JSON is the CLI boundary;
TypeScript may use `defineTheme` for typing as long as the resulting object
remains JSON-compatible.

## Start with project meaning

Define any number of raw palettes, then name the roles your product needs:

```json
{
  "$schema": "flowstack.theme.v1",
  "metadata": { "id": "acme", "name": "Acme" },
  "compatibility": { "brick": "^0.1.9" },
  "appearances": {
    "supported": ["light", "dark"],
    "default": "system"
  },
  "palettes": {
    "brand": {
      "blue": "#2457c5",
      "orange": "#c44d18",
      "magenta": "#a53c8e"
    }
  },
  "roles": {
    "brandPrimary": "{palettes.brand.blue}",
    "promotion": "{palettes.brand.magenta}"
  }
}
```

Extra colors are not forced into Brick's smaller vocabulary. Charts,
campaigns, syntax, editorial colors, maps, and future Block roles remain in
`roles` or a namespaced `extensions` object and emit as
`--flowstack-theme-*` variables.

## Appearance-aware project roles

Use `appearanceRoles` when one project meaning must adapt with light and dark
appearance without becoming a required Brick semantic:

```json
{
  "appearanceRoles": {
    "light": {
      "blocks": {
        "expressiveSurface": {
          "surface": "#4a2f00",
          "foreground": "#ffffff"
        }
      }
    },
    "dark": {
      "blocks": {
        "expressiveSurface": {
          "surface": "#2f2108",
          "foreground": "#ffffff"
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "relationships": {
    "contrast": [
      {
        "id": "blocks-expressive-surface-content",
        "kind": "text",
        "foreground": "blocks.expressiveSurface.foreground",
        "background": "blocks.expressiveSurface.surface",
        "minimumRatio": 4.5
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The compiler emits stable
`--flowstack-theme-roles-blocks-expressive-surface-*` variables under the
active appearance selectors. Every logical role must exist in every supported
appearance. Declared project contrast relationships must resolve to opaque
sRGB colors and meet the same unrounded WCAG 2 floors used for Brick pairs.
Keep media-composition and transparency checks in the consuming product.

## Map Brick semantics

The `brick` section changes stable UI meanings. Map by purpose, not merely by
hue: a promotional orange is not a warning unless it communicates warning.

```json
{
  "brick": {
    "light": {
      "color": {
        "accent": {
          "border": "#829fe0",
          "on-soft": "#173b86",
          "on-solid": "#ffffff",
          "soft": "#e8efff",
          "soft-hover": "#d9e5ff",
          "soft-pressed": "#c6d7ff",
          "solid": "{roles.brandPrimary}",
          "solid-hover": "#1c489f",
          "solid-pressed": "#173d88",
          "text": "#214b9e"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Brick publishes atomic families. Changing one member requires every member of
that family for the same appearance; omitting the entire family safely
inherits Brick's defaults. This prevents a new rest color from accidentally
keeping unrelated hover, pressed, or foreground values.

## Other sections

- `foundations` accepts contract-declared appearance-invariant typography,
  radius, density, and motion paths. Appearance-dependent semantic shadows are
  mapped under `brick.light.shadow` and `brick.dark.shadow`.
- `components` accepts only Brick's audited inherited component inputs. It is
  not a selector or arbitrary-recipe registry. For example,
  `components.link.decoration` accepts the intent values `"always"` or
  `"interaction"`; the latter emits interaction-only decoration and compiles
  only when the theme's accent link text remains at least `3:1` distinct from
  adjacent primary text. A single Link can still override the theme with
  `variant="underline"` or `variant="plain"`.
- `requirements` records application work such as font and asset loading.
- `guidance` records intent and review notes for people and agents.
- `relationships.contrast` validates explicit foreground/background pairs
  from `appearanceRoles`; it does not expand Brick's semantic vocabulary.

Aliases must occupy the complete value, for example
`"{roles.brandPrimary}"`. Unknown aliases, cycles, unsupported values,
incomplete families, and unknown Brick paths fail compilation.
